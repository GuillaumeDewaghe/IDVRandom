                                       (8)

- The information displayed on the persona web is not defined yet
- The persona web will work as the "clock system" in IDV showed by the number between parentheses (which will be not displayed)
- There are the rules :
    * If the random number is 4/8/12/16, only the half of the branch will be full, to have the other half, you will need to have the same number again
    * If you have the other numbers, the branch will be full
    * As for the normal persona web, the number of points is limited to 120
